    President Donald Trump has returned to the campaign trail less than two weeks after testing positive for coronavirus.

    He told thousands of supporters, many not wearing masks, that he could give them "a big fat kiss", at a rally in the
    battleground state of Florida.

    His rival, Joe Biden, speaking in Ohio, accused the president of "reckless behaviour" since his diagnosis.

    The two presidential candidates are scrambling to secure votes with three weeks until the 3 November election.

    Opinion polls suggests Mr Biden has a 10-point lead over Mr Trump nationally. However his lead in some key states is
    narrower - as is the case in Florida, where the Democrat is 3.7 points ahead, according to an average of polls
    collated by Real Clear Politics.

    How is Donald Trump doing in the polls?
    Why are infections rising again in US?
    Battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio are crucial for gathering the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White
    House, which is not determined by a simple popular ballot count.

    Mr Trump tested positive for Covid-19 some 11 days ago, and was admitted to Walter Reed Medical Center a day later.

    But on Sunday his personal doctor said he was no longer a Covid transmission risk to others and disclosed on Monday
    that his most recent tests were negative over consecutive days, although he did not give the dates.

    The usual chants of "Four more years!" were heard as hundreds queued to enter the open air space where the president
    made his appearance.

    People have been getting their temperature checked and were offered face masks. Those who covered up didn't think it
    was too soon for the president to be out and about. They said they admired him for it. One man here told me he was
    originally from New York and had made Florida his home - just like "his hero" Donald Trump.

    The Trump campaign team is throwing everything at Florida - a loss here makes his return to the White House near
    impossible.

    Over the weekend, his eldest son Donald Trump Jr concluded his Florida bus tour, "Fighters Against Socialism" - a
    pitch primarily aimed at Hispanic voters.

    Vice-President Mike Pence recently visited "The Villages" a famous retirement home to turn out the elderly vote.

    But though the president and some of his supporters here seem relaxed about coronavirus, it has hit Florida hard, with
    more than 15,000 deaths. Joe Biden arrives here on Tuesday. His team are focusing on the administration's handling of
    the pandemic and plan to carry out a quieter but vigorous campaign in key suburban areas which they hope will help
    flip the state blue.

    Presentational grey line
    What did Trump say at the rally?
    In his first stump appearance following his Covid-19 diagnosis and recovery, a re-invigorated Mr Trump returned to his
    campaign's familiar themes and lines of attack against Mr Biden.

    He touted stock market growth, the establishment of the US Space Force and his successful confirmation of two
    conservative Supreme Court justices to the bench - with a third nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, before the Senate
    this week - as major achievements.

    Before a crowd of several thousand he denounced plans to prolong shutdowns supported by Democrats and sought to
    question Mr Biden's mental acuity.
